This was a challange 🥇

I build a layout/landing page with implemention for some functionalities using Vanilla JS.
The task was really challenging for me and i learnt alot as well, but I consider myself to have achieved my goal.

Could the code be written more efficiently? Probably. 
Am I using the most logical solutions? Maybe not, but do works and this has been a really good learning process.
Built with

    JavaScript 👍
    Semantic HTML5 markup
    SCSS/CSS custom properties
    Flexbox
    Grid

What to do differently next time?

More planning! 🤔
